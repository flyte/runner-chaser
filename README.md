Runner/Chaser
=============

Description
-----------

A 'game' of sorts taking place on a grid of squares featuring two characters: the runner and the chaser, both with a propensity for finding and eating apples. The chaser, in contrast to the runner, is carnivorous. If the runner is closer to the chaser than any of the apples, then it will find itself the target of the chaser's murderous intent. Luckily, the runner can move two places in each turn so has a chance to remove itself from danger.
